            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>Greek Housing Coordinator</h3>
            <p>As Greek Housing Coordinator, my role is to facilitate the smooth day-to-day operation of my house, including acting as a        liaison between executive and administrative bodies. It is my responsibility to advocate for my residents and ensure compliance with the universities policy. Some specific tasks I am responsible for are: (1) having regular meetings with (2-6 per week) with the executive committee, residence life committee, an accountability committee, my resident community, and 1:1's with my direct supervisor; (2) relay information between all associated parties as is necessary for the smooth and accountable operation of the greek house; (3) schedule regular 1:1 meetings (2-4 per semester) with all my residents for a personal check-in of their academic status, current stresses, and mental/physical health, reporting any concerns I have up the ladder.</p>
            <h3>Robotics Competition</h3>
            <p>I participated in an afterschool robotics club throughout both middle and highschool, 
                where I was a principle engineer and programmer. Through excellent collaboration and 
                rigorous testing we were able to strategize a way to compete our way to first place in 
                a city-wide robotics competition.</p>
            <h3>Robotics Volunteering</h3>
            <p>In Highschool, when I wasn't busy with my Full-IB classload and my own robotics work, 
                I went back and volunteered to work with the after-school robotics club at my own local
                middle school (Stewart, on Pacific Ave.), where I helped teach young students the 
                fundamentals of engineering design and facilitated their exploration of the design process
                as well as how to practically and efficiently solve tough competition related problems.</li>
            </p>
            <h3>FSAD Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>Last semester I took a bootcamp course online in addition to my UPS course load which taught
                me the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and SQL, as well as how to dynamically link them using Python
                integration. I designed a little toy app website called "dogchat" to test out some of the things 
                I learned.

            <h3>Stock Trading and Portfolio Management Tool</h3>
            <p>Using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React built on Node.js) to create a powerful and 
                integrated application which is used to ....</p>
            <h3>Physics-Based Projectile Game (JS)</h3>
            <p>Using node.js and a physics engine, matter.js which provides a basic engine and renderer. Using these basic building blocks, I created a randomly generated structure which uses the current level as an input for an infinitely scaling regressive difficulty calculation. </p>
            <h3>Half-Precision Floating Point Adder Circuit</h3>
            <p>Using Logisim I created a floating point adder / subtractor circuit capable of Operating
                on half-precision floating point binary or hexadecimal inputs following the IEEE standard
                for encoding floating point data.</p>
            <h3>C Shell</h3>
            <p>I created my own shell terminal program using C. It was a simplified version of a standard
                shell but it did support both syncronous and asyncronous file execution as well as a series
                of custom commands in addition to root binary support.</p>
