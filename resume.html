            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>Robotics Competition</h3>
            <p>I participated in an afterschool robotics club throughout both middle and highschool, 
                where I was a principle engineer and programmer. Through excellent collaboration and 
                rigorous testing we were able to strategize a way to compete our way to first place in 
                a city-wide robotics competition.</p>
            <h3>Robotics Volunteering</h3>
            <p>In Highschool, when I wasn't busy with my Full-IB classload and my own robotics work, 
                I went back and volunteered to work with the after-school robotics club at my own local
                middle school (Stewart, on Pacific Ave.), where I helped teach young students the 
                fundamentals of engineering design and facilitated their exploration of the design process
                as well as how to practically and efficiently solve tough competition related problems.</li>
            </p>
            <h3>FSAD Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>Last semester I took a bootcamp course online in addition to my UPS course load which taught
                me the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and SQL, as well as how to dynamically link them using Python
                integration. I designed a little toy app website called "dogchat" to test out some of the things 
                I learned.

            <h2>Technical Projects</h2>
            <h3>Half-Precision Floating Point Adder Circuit</h3>
            <p>Using Logisim I created a floating point adder / subtractor circuit capable of Operating
                on half-precision floating point binary or hexadecimal inputs following the IEEE standard
                for encoding floating point data.</p>
            <h3>C Shell</h3>
            <p>I created my own shell terminal program using C. It was a simplified version of a standard
                shell but it did support both syncronous and asyncronous file execution as well as a series
                of custom commands in addition to root binary support.</p>
